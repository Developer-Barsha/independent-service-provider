        "question":"Difference between authorization and authentication",
        "answer":"Authentication checks that users are who they say they are. Authentication is the process of identifying a user. If users given credentials match with the credentials stored in a database/server of authorized users then the user is allowed to access the resource. But Authorization comes after authentication. Authorization is a security mechanism that determines the access level of the user."
